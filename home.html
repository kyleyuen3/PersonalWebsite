        <h2>Hi, I'm Kyle Yuen ðŸ‘‹</h2>
        <p>
        I'm a recent college graduate and a passionate developer who enjoys creating personal projects. 
        In my free time, I enjoy taking ideas I have and turning them into projects, ehance my cooking skills, 
        and just started learning photography. I love building things that not only work well but also feel meaningful to use.
        </p>
        <p>
        Outside of tech, I enjoy playing basketball, working out, and spending time with friends online or in person. 
        Whether itâ€™s coding in my free time, working on personal projects, or competing in games, Iâ€™m always looking to learn, grow, 
        and stay active.
        </p>
